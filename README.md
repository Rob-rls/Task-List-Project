# Task-List-Project
This is my project to help me learn Ruby
The idea is to create a task list that stores a list that can be saved after the program closes.  The user can add, view and modify items in the list.   The user should then be able to remove items once the task is completed.

The project is now complete!  The program works as defined above.  

Some ideas to update as I learn more Ruby:
1. Make it web-based!  Command line only programs are so 1980's... :)
2. Use Gems to give it a GUI
3. Allow the user to retreive different list ie, "Shopping List" and "Holiday Checklist" etc..
